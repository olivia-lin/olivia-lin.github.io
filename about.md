My name is Olivia, a recent graduate student of Master of Data Science (MDS) from the University of British Columbia. Now, I am actively seeking data scientists, machine learning engineer, and data analyst opportunities in the greater Vancouver area.

I have strong passion about the filed of data science and artificial intelligence because I think these are powerful tools to make the world and people’s life better. As myself a fast learner and problem solver, I enjoy exploring and learning new things so I always keep updating my skillsets.

I was born and raised in China, and went to the North America senven years ago. I love arts and architectures. My favourite artists are Monet and Morisot.
